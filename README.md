# Techdegree Project 1

This project challenges students to create an array of quote objects to be randomly selected for display to the user, as well as randomly-generated background colors.

Project 1 is fairly simple, but the challenge for a new JavaScript developer is real, and I appreciated the opportunity to consolidate course content in a meaningful way. The HTML and CSS were provided by Team Treehouse.
